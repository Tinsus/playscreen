### Stuff to do ###
- server is set by opening sever-specific file setting tag in session its the server and than redirecting to the very same pages the players goes
- if localhost or not: url always includes subfolder (much more easy)
- player-position save and shown on edge of the screen
- https://jqueryui.com/droppable/
- rework matchmaking: only one file for matchmaking, using php classes and AJAX
- setup.php (server: setup game specific settings + wait for players) and custom.php (player: setup avatar or similar stuff) still missing
- php classes for stuff like Player (::New ::Get -> link session to player-id)
- detect disconnected players and allow reconnect
- allow load old games to reconnect players
